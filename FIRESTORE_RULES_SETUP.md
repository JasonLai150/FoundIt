# Firestore Security Rules Setup

## Problem
You're getting "Missing or insufficient permissions" when trying to create user documents in Firestore.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Use Secure Rules

**DO NOT use overly permissive rules in production!** Here's how to set up secure rules:

### 1. Go to Firebase Console
- Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/foundit-fd4bf
- Click on "Firestore Database" in the sidebar
- Click on the "Rules" tab

### 2. Use These SECURE Rules
Replace the current rules with this code:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read and write their own user document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read other users' profiles (for matching)
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Future: Add rules for matches, chats, etc.
    // match /matches/{matchId} {
    //   allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    //     (resource.data.user1 == request.auth.uid || resource.data.user2 == request.auth.uid);
    // }
  }
}
```

### 3. Publish the Rules
- Click "Publish" to save the new rules

## What These Secure Rules Do:

- **‚úÖ Allow**: Authenticated users to create/read/update their own profile
- **‚úÖ Allow**: Authenticated users to read other users' profiles (needed for browsing/matching)
- **‚ùå Deny**: Unauthenticated users from accessing any data
- **‚ùå Deny**: Users from modifying other users' profiles
- **‚ùå Deny**: Any access to non-existent collections

## üö® ONLY If Secure Rules Don't Work:

If you're still getting permission errors with the secure rules above, you can **temporarily** use these for debugging:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated users
    }
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning**: 
- The testing rules above still allow any authenticated user to modify any data
- Use them ONLY for debugging
- Switch back to the secure rules immediately after testing
- NEVER deploy to production with testing rules

## After Updating Rules:
1. Try registering a new user
2. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users to see if the user was created
3. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Data to see if the user document was created

## Troubleshooting:
If you still get permission errors with the secure rules:
1. Make sure the user is actually authenticated (check Firebase Auth console)
2. Verify the document path is `/users/{uid}` where `{uid}` matches the authenticated user's UID
3. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
